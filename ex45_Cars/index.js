// 45.Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
//creating a function and storing a car object in it with optional parameters...
function CreateCar(manufacturer, model) {
    var optionalInfo = [];
    for (var _i = 2; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {
        optionalInfo[_i - 2] = arguments[_i];
    }
    // initializing a car object with manufacturer and model
    var myCar = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
    };
    //to add additinal options ,creating a key value method and spliting the key and value by (:), and also using .trim() to remove whitespaces
    optionalInfo.forEach(function (Option) {
        var _a = Option.split(":"), key = _a[0], value = _a[1];
        myCar[key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });
    return myCar;
}
// now calling the function to create a car object
var my_car = CreateCar("Toyota", "Corolla", "color: White", "Sunroof: True", "Year: 2020");
//now printing the variable to ensure that all the info is stored correctly in the car object
console.log(my_car);
