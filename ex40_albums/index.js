// 40.Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
//creating a function that builds a Object:
function make_album(artist_name, album_title, tracks) {
    var music_album = {
        artist: artist_name,
        albumTitle: album_title,
    };
    if (tracks !== undefined) {
        music_album.tracks = tracks;
    }
    ;
    return music_album;
}
;
//now calling the function 3 times and creating 3 variables with diff values:
var album1 = make_album("artist no.1", "albumTitle no.1");
var album2 = make_album("arist no.2", "albumTitle no.2");
//calling our function with third parameter tracks:
var album3 = make_album("arist no.3", "albumtitle no.3", 5);
//printing value of our object:
console.log(album1);
console.log(album2);
console.log(album3);
