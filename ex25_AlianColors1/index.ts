// 25.Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)


let alian_color: string = "Black";

if(alian_color === "Black"){
    console.log("Alian color is Black the player just earned 5 points."); //it will print the message bcz condition is true.
}

if(alian_color === "White"){
    console.log("Alian color is white.")         //it will not print anything bcz the condition is false.
}
